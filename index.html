            <h3>Background information</h3>
    
            <p>Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Their target market is women's health.
                Urška Sršen and Sando Mur are the cofounders of Bellabeat. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women
                around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower
                women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and
                quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.
    
                Sršen is confident that an analysis of non-Bellebeat consumer data (ie. FitBit fitness tracker usage data) would reveal more opportunities for the company's growth.

            <h2>B: Data Preparation</h2>
    
            <h3>Data Source</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is stored in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit" style="color: black;">Kaggle Public Dataset</a> in 18 different files in the Excel and CSV formats.</li>
            
                <li>The dataset involves health and fitness based fit-bit data of 30 volunteering candidates.</li>
    
                <li>The dataset is generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016</li>
    
                <li>Data collected includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Limitations of the Dataset</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The dataset involves readings of only 30 individuals, which is not representative of the entire fitness community.</li>
    
                <li>The dataset is quite old (2016), therefore might not be representative of the current trends.</li>
    
            </ul>
    
        </div>
    
    
        <div class="Data-Processing" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    
            <h2>C: Data Processing</h2>
    
            <p>The data present in the datase is not clean enough, and requires some manipulation which will support the analysis.</p>
            <p>Tools used - Excel, SQL and R</p>
    
            <h3>Data Cleaning in Excel</h3>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Checking for null values</h4>
                    <p>All the datasets are checked for null values using conditional formatting.</p>
                    <p>No null values are found.</p>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <h4>Checking for duplicate values</h4>
                    <p>All the datasets are checked for duplicates in Excel.</p>
                    <p>No duplicate values found were found.</p>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <h4>Checking for incorrect data types in all columns</h4>
                    <p>All the columns in each dataset are checked and corrected with the appropriate data type.</p>
                    <p>The main issue was the date and time format, which varied across the data of all the users. Therefore, I converted them into a single format.</p>
                </li>
    
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Data Cleaning in SQL & R</h3>
    
            <p>Out of all the files in the dataset, some of them were relatively larger in size, hence could not be cleaned in Excel. Therefore, I have used much more powerful tools like SQL and R to clean and manipulate the data. </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Checking for null values</h4>
                    <p>All the datasets are checked for null values in SQL.</p>
    
                    <p>For example, in 'daily_activity_merged' dataset:</p>
                    <pre class="sql">
                        <code>
    SELECT  
    SUM(CASE WHEN Id IS NULL THEN 1 else 0 END) As Id_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ActivityDate IS NULL THEN 1 else 0 END) As Date_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN TotalSteps IS NULL THEN 1 else 0 END) As Steps_null_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN TotalDistance IS NULL THEN 1 else 0 END) As Dist_null_count

    FROM `bellabeat-393115.daily_activity.daily_acitvity_updated_csv` 
    
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <h5>Result:</h5>
                    <div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="Resources\Query_1_Result.jpg" alt="Query_1_Result"/>
                    </div>
    
                    <p>As an Example, I have checked if the first four columns have null values. The query checks every row in a given column, and add one to the result if it finds a null value.</p>
                    <p>No null values are found in the first 4 columns.</p>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <h4>Checking for duplicate values</h4>
                    <p>All the datasets are checked for duplicates in SQL.</p>
    
                    <p>For example, in 'daily_activity_merged' dataset:</p>
                    <pre class="sql">
                        <code>
    SELECT 

    Id, count(Id) as count_of_Id

    FROM `bellabeat-393115.daily_activity.daily_acitvity_updated_csv`

    Group By Id, ActivityDate
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <h5>Result:</h5>
                    <div style="display: flex; width: 100%; justify-content: center;">
                        <img src="Resources\Query_2_Result.jpg" alt="Query_2_Result"/>
                    </div>
    
                    <p>Here the count of every Id is checked by grouping by the Id's and by the Activity Dates, as There are multiple values of the same Id, but on different dates.</p>
                    <p>As we can see, all the counts are 1's, hence no duplicate values are found.</p>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <h4>Checking for incorrect data types in all columns</h4>
                    <p>Just like in the previous case, all the columns were checked and corrected with the appropriate data type.</p>
                    <p>For example, Correction of Data datatype for the 'daily_activity' dataset in R </p>
                </li>
    
            </ul>

            <h3>D: Data Analysis</h3>
    
            <p>The next step in the process is to manipulate the data to make it easier to analyse.</p>
    
            
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Joins</h4>
    
                    <p>This process involves combining multiple relations (or tables) in the dataset to further support in depth analysis.</p>
    
                    <h4>For Example, - (in R)</h4>
                    <p>In order to analyse sleep data with daily activity, the 'sleep_day_merged' and 'daily_activity_merged'datasets are inner joined into a single dataset 'sleep_step_rel'.</p>
                    <p>First, the 'tidyverse' library is installed and called.</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
    install.packages("tidyverse")
    library(tidyverse)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
    
                    <p>Then the datasets are imported to R Studio and assigned to variables.</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
    daily_activity <- read_xlsx("Bellabeat/daily_activity_merged.xlsx")
    sleep_data <- read_xlsx('Bellabeat/sleep_day_merged.xlsx')
                        </code>
                    </pre>
    
                    <p>After this, both the datasets undergo some data manipulation (covered in next section), and are inner joined on the basis of Id and ActivityDate. </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
    #Total Minutes Manipulation
    daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% 
        mutate(totalMinutes = VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes+SedentaryMinutes)

    #Sleep Date Manipulation
    sleep_data$SleepDay <- as.Date(sleep_data$SleepDay)
    sleep_data <- sleep_data %>%
        mutate (SleepRatio = TotalMinutesAsleep / TotalTimeInBed)

    #Inner Join
    sleep_step_rel <- inner_join(daily_activity, sleep_data, by = c('ActivityDate', 'Id'))
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>Therefore, the new dataset contins the data of both the daily activity and sleep for any given Id and Date.</p>
                </li>
    
                <h4>Or in Sql</h4>
    
                <pre class="sql">
                    <code>
    SELECT *
    FROM `bellabeat-393115.daily_activity.daily_acitvity_updated_csv` as daily_activity
    INNER JOIN `bellabeat-393115.daily_activity.sleep_data` as sleep_data 
    ON daily_activity.Id = sleep_data.Id AND daily_activity.ActivityDate = sleep_data.ActivityDate
                    </code>
                </pre>
    
                <p>Join can be done using SQL as well. In the above code, both the tables (daily_activity and sleep_data) are selected and inner joined on the basis of Id and ActivityDate.</p>
    
                <li>
                    <h4>Data Manipulation</h4>
    
                    <p> This proces involves converting and manipulating the data within the dataset to make the analysis easier.</p>
                    <p> For Example - In the previous step of inner join, some data manipulation is done in the daily_activity and sleep_data variables to allow easier analysis.</p>
    
                    <pre>
                        <code>
    #Total Minutes Manipulation
    daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% 
    mutate(totalMinutes = VeryActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+LightlyActiveMinutes+SedentaryMinutes)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>The LightlyActiveMinutes column gives the total amount of minutes spent slightly active throughout the day. Similarly, the VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes and SedentaryMinutes all calculate their respective values. However, we are interested in total minutes logged in to the tracker, hence a new column called 'TotalMinutes' is added to the dataset which adds all the time values.</p>
    
                    <pre>
                        <code>
    #Sleep Date Manipulation
    sleep_data$SleepDay <- as.Date(sleep_data$SleepDay)
    sleep_data <- sleep_data %>%
    mutate (SleepRatio = TotalMinutesAsleep / TotalTimeInBed)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>This manipultion involves changing the dataset of the SleepDay column, initially from String type to Date type. A new column 'SleepRatio' is created which is the ratio between Totl time spent sleeping vy total time in bed. it is basically a measure of quality of sleep. Higer the sleep ratio, better the sleep quality.</p>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <h4>Statistical Calculations</h4>
    
                    <p>Statistical measures like mean, median, standard deviation, etc. are calculated to get some insights.</p>
                    <p>For example, in the inner joined dataset which consists of data involving daily steps, intensities and levels of activity : </p>
    
                    <pre class="sql">
                        <code>

            <h3>E: Data Visualization</h3>
    
            <p>This step involves visualizing defferent trends from the clean dataset, in order to get valuable insights. For this section, I will be using R and Tableau.</p>

            <h3>F: Acting based on the insights</h3>
    
            <p>From the trends observed because of the data analysis, we got a lot of insights on the fitness tracker industry. These insights can be used to identify potential growth opportunities for Bellabeat.</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    From the Statistical calculations performed on 'daily_activity' database, we got to know that average steps taken per day is around 8500, which is below the recommended 10000 steps per day. Moreover, the mean time spent sedentary takes up most of the day. Therefore, the Bellabeat app can be made such that the users receive periodic notifications encouraging them to stay active.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    We got to know that the number of log-ins to the fitness app is the least on the week-ends. Also, more calories are burnt when more steps are taken everyday. These challenges also can be solved by notifying the users to stay active in the weekends and to finish their step goals. Introducing points system where new points are granted for every achievement succeded can greatly motivate the users.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    The points system can be set to reward the users when a given set of achievements are completed per day - like completing step goals, staying hydrated, having quality sleep, etc.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Some weekly goals can also be set, like weight loss goals, which can further encourage the users to stay fit and active.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Also, Bellabeat app can educate and encourage the users by providing free fitness programs, diet plans and calorie charts.
